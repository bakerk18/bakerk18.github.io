> *Semper ego auditor tantum?*  
(Will I always just be a listener?)  
-Juvenal, Satire 1


I used to repeatedly ask myself: why write? Now I only ask: why not?

But it wasn't always so simple. On a two hour flight without internet, I began a list of my reasons for writing. It was incomplete then and, even with periodic additions, remains so today.

Why write:
1. To create. I have spent most of my life consuming media, almost none of it creating.
2. To clarify. I ruminate and oscillate. Writing forces me to commit, word by word, to something stable. I hope to clarify my own reasoning. Once I do that, maybe I can even help others do the same.
3. To document. As a historian, I have a certain reverence for sources. This blog will serve as a record for myself (and maybe others, human and AI).
